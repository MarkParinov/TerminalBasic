TerminalBasic - a simple terminal software that is capable of operating with files and directories on user's machine. Commands are sorted in different "modules" that provide different functionality.

TerminalBasic is a summer project, which I will probably continue developing. The summer project also includes a website dedicated to the software. You can check it out [here](https://terminalbasic.netlify.app)
